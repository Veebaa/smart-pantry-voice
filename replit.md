## Deployment Configuration
- **Target**: Autoscale (stateless web application)
- **Build**: `bun run build` (compiles TypeScript to dist/)
- **Run**: `bun run start` (NODE_ENV=production node dist/server/index.js)
- **Port**: 5000 → 80 (external)
- **Health Check**: Both `/` and `/health` respond immediately before routes load
- **Static Files**: Served synchronously at startup (before server.listen)
- **Database**: Connects lazily on first API request

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the application (click Publish button)
2. Request API keys from user if needed (LOVABLE_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY)
3. Test voice assistant functionality
4. Test text-to-speech features

## Development
```bash
# Start development server
bun run dev

# Run database migrations
bun run db:push

# View database in Drizzle Studio
bun run db:studio
```

## Testing
```bash
# Run all unit tests
bun run test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
bun run test:coverage

# Run frontend component tests
bun run test:client

# Run E2E tests (requires server running)
bun run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI
bun run test:e2e:ui
```

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions
The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs on:
- Push to main/master branches
- Pull requests to main/master branches

**Jobs:**
1. **unit-tests** - Runs Vitest unit tests with coverage
2. **frontend-tests** - Runs frontend component tests
3. **e2e-tests** - Runs Playwright E2E tests
4. **lint** - Runs ESLint
5. **typecheck** - Runs TypeScript type checking
6. **build** - Builds the production application

**Artifacts:**
- Coverage reports (7 days retention)
- Playwright HTML reports (30 days retention)
- Playwright screenshots on failure (7 days retention)

## Notes
- The voice assistant uses the Lovable AI Gateway (Gemini 2.5 Flash model)
- Text-to-speech uses OpenAI's TTS API
- Browser may cache old code - do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) if issues occur
- All API endpoints require authentication except signup/signin
